Are trilateration and triangulation the same thing? No, they are totally different. Triangulation and trilateration are two methods used in land surveying to determine horizontal measurements. The basic difference between triangulation and trilateration is that triangulation involves the measurement of angles, while trilateration involves the measurement of length.
